# Data Analysis Files

## Deidentified Survey and Analysis Data
The survey data from this study were deidentified meaning that they are not only anonymous, but also lack specific personal data that, when combined, might enable someone to deduce an individual's identity. The definitions for the survey categories (columns) are stored in a separate Excel file.

## Analysis Scripts
We have also posted R scripts to recreate the figures and statistical analyses from the paper. The scripts were created and run using R (version 4.2.0) and RStudio (version 2022.02.2). They implement the following libraries: tidyverse (1.3.2), ggsankey (0.0.99999), patchwork (1.2.0), car (3.1-2), emmeans (1.8.5), DHARMa (0.4.6), glmmTMB (1.1.7), and performance (0.10.9.9).
